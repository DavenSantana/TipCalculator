# Tip Calculator

This is an Android Studio App with a purpose to be able to figure out the amount of tip that should be paid when a group of people go out to a restaurant. The app will return to you the tip per person on the line where it says "Tip:" and it will return the total tip for the whole check where it says "Total:"

## How to use the App

- First you enter the total amount of the check or bill in the "Check Amount:" line.
- Next you enter the party size or the amount of people who went on the "Party Size:" line.
- After that you click the "Compute Tip" button which will give you the results for the tip for each person and the total tip. 
- *Note the tip for each person doesn't include change, it is rounded to the closest number, so if for example a person should be paying 24.25 for the tip, the calculator will round down to 24 instead of up.

- This is what the application looks like when there are numbers inputted and the tip leads to it being rounded down per person (here for 20% and 25% the tip is rounded down per person since they would owe some value and 33 cents in each case so since it's rounded down.):

- This is what the application looks like when there are numbers inputted and the tip leads to it being rounded up per person (here for 20% and 25% the tip is rounded up per person since they would owe some value and 66 cents so for example, at 20% each person would owe 12.66 so it's rounded up to 13):
